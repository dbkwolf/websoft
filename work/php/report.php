      <p> <h5>Did you before know about the techniques Git,
        GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</h5> Yes, I did know about git and
        githubpages before this course and tried to use it in my previous projects.
      </p>
      <p><h5> Have you ever created websites before?</h5> Yes, I have created
        websites but I am certain I didn't use best practice. just wanted to get it
        done. Most of my knowledge is based on trial and error and working from
        examples. I read literature on Javascript but unlike with Java, I have less
        experience in knowing where to begin when starting a project. </P>
      <p><h5>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</h5> My
        knowledge within web is very limited to basic CSS, JavaScript and HTML. I made
        portfolio websites using templates and tailoring them to my needs. Also
        created a website for previous projects. </p>
      <p> <h5>What is your TIL for this
        course section?</h5> TIL: that gitterbox existed; why tags are useful. </p>

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S02 - HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4></span>
          <hr>

      <p><h5>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</h5>
        Yes, I looked at the MDN pages and the Introductory JAvascript tutorials
        for other courses and managed to get a good understanding of how they all
        work together at a very basic level </p>
      <p><h5>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</h5>
        HTML determines the structure, much like the skeletton of the web page, CSS determines how all these
        structural pieces look like ot the user, and Javascript determines how
        these function i.e. the actions available on the webpage, generally to
        make a dynamic rather than a static website.</p>
      <p><h5>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server
        interacts.</h5> Browser is the client and makes it possible to communicate
        to the server by providing a platform where websites can be loaded to
        facilitate this interaction. The HTTP protocol are the sets of rules that
        both the browser and server need to follow to be able to communicate.</p>
      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5> Good resources were
        provided to look up more information about these topics which i will
        probably use a lot more of in the future.</p>

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S03 - Client side JavaScript with AJAX</h4></span>
          <hr>
      <p><h5>Do you have any previous experience of client side
        JavaScript?</h5> Very little and informal experience from previous projects
        where it was less about doing things right and more about getting things
        done. </p>
      <p><h5>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any
        other language you know?</h5>  Yes, mix of c# with a functional programming
        language such as haskell, but very little of the latter. In terms of
        immutability, definitely. </p>
      <p><h5>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to
        be?</h5>  I accidentally did things required for grade 5 before attempting the
        lower grade tasks. I never had any intention to not do all of them, so it
        didn't matter to me. </p>
      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5>
        Working with json objects and fetch. It was the part of the assignment that
        took me the longest time to grasp. More specifically the CORS issues that I
        had even when running the page from a CORS enabled server, then I tried
        disabling it. I finally decided to try a proxy, which worked immediately.
        Only upon reading the assignment again did I realize that it wasn't required
        from us to get the data directly from the API. But then it was already done.

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S04 -Server side JavaScript with Node and Express</h4></span>
          <hr>
      <p><h5>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal
        programming tools.</h5>    I had no experience with node or npm before this
        assignment.I had heard about it and noticed it listed in many job ads
        but never understood when it would be appropriate to use.</p>

      <p><h5>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</h5>
          I still feel like there is not much structure to what I code in
        JavaScript. Especially since I am trying to use a more functional
        approach rather than an object oriented. Regarding Node and Express, I
        like Node, the command and debugger... but Express as templating tool
        was really uncomfortable to learn. I wonder if other templating tools
        would be better. Express felt so stubborn and just unwilling to
        co-operate in general. Really frustrating. Hated working with it, but
        the result was very satisfying. </p>

      <p><h5>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a
        plan and did it work?</h5>   At first-sight the tasks were simple. I
        knew what I was supposed to do and was determined to tackle tasks as
        they came. Grade 3 tasks were a breeze, the problems arose in grade 4.
        I was trying to solve it, and thought I understood what I was required
        to do but it turns out I had a massive knowledge hole regarding JSON
        responses and GET/POST requests. So much so, that after I finished the
        tasks for Grade 4, I continued to the Grade 5 tasks and realized I had
        already done those and NOT Grade 4. So back I went, re-purposed my
        solutions that I had done earlier and filled that knowledge hole I was
        so blind about. In total, Grades 3-5, it took me a total of 16hrs over
        the weekend, although half the time was spent researching and reading
        online material. I had no plan other than tackling the tasks one by
        one. </p>

      <p><h5>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</h5>   I
        always aim for a 5. Grade 5 was actually a lot easier than Grade 4
        ...in my head. In hindsight Grade 4 was super easy and straight
        forward but it turns out I gneuinely didn't know what we were required
        to do. I naively thought that every GET/POST request generated a
        response, and I thought responses were always JSON. I was very
        mistaken. </p>

      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5>   Many, many
        things. How to set up a node server, and organize the modules; How to
        use a templating framework; Basically how to set up a Server-side
        dynamic webpage from scratch. ...Oh, and that stupid JSON response thing, so dumb. </p>
