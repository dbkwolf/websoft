      <p> <h5>Did you before know about the techniques Git,
        GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</h5> Yes, I did know about git and
        githubpages before this course and tried to use it in my previous projects.
      </p>
      <p><h5> Have you ever created websites before?</h5> Yes, I have created
        websites but I am certain I didn't use best practice. just wanted to get it
        done. Most of my knowledge is based on trial and error and working from
        examples. I read literature on Javascript but unlike with Java, I have less
        experience in knowing where to begin when starting a project. </P>
      <p><h5>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</h5> My
        knowledge within web is very limited to basic CSS, JavaScript and HTML. I made
        portfolio websites using templates and tailoring them to my needs. Also
        created a website for previous projects. </p>
      <p> <h5>What is your TIL for this
        course section?</h5> TIL: that gitterbox existed; why tags are useful. </p>

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S02 - HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4></span>
          <hr>

      <p><h5>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</h5>
        Yes, I looked at the MDN pages and the Introductory JAvascript tutorials
        for other courses and managed to get a good understanding of how they all
        work together at a very basic level </p>
      <p><h5>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</h5>
        HTML determines the structure, much like the skeletton of the web page, CSS determines how all these
        structural pieces look like ot the user, and Javascript determines how
        these function i.e. the actions available on the webpage, generally to
        make a dynamic rather than a static website.</p>
      <p><h5>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server
        interacts.</h5> Browser is the client and makes it possible to communicate
        to the server by providing a platform where websites can be loaded to
        facilitate this interaction. The HTTP protocol are the sets of rules that
        both the browser and server need to follow to be able to communicate.</p>
      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5> Good resources were
        provided to look up more information about these topics which i will
        probably use a lot more of in the future.</p>

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S03 - Client side JavaScript with AJAX</h4></span>
          <hr>
      <p><h5>Do you have any previous experience of client side
        JavaScript?</h5> Very little and informal experience from previous projects
        where it was less about doing things right and more about getting things
        done. </p>
      <p><h5>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any
        other language you know?</h5>  Yes, mix of c# with a functional programming
        language such as haskell, but very little of the latter. In terms of
        immutability, definitely. </p>
      <p><h5>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to
        be?</h5>  I accidentally did things required for grade 5 before attempting the
        lower grade tasks. I never had any intention to not do all of them, so it
        didn't matter to me. </p>
      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5>
        Working with json objects and fetch. It was the part of the assignment that
        took me the longest time to grasp. More specifically the CORS issues that I
        had even when running the page from a CORS enabled server, then I tried
        disabling it. I finally decided to try a proxy, which worked immediately.
        Only upon reading the assignment again did I realize that it wasn't required
        from us to get the data directly from the API. But then it was already done.

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S04 - Server side JavaScript with Node and Express</h4></span>
          <hr>
      <p><h5>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal
        programming tools.</h5>    I had no experience with node or npm before this
        assignment.I had heard about it and noticed it listed in many job ads
        but never understood when it would be appropriate to use.</p>

      <p><h5>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</h5>
          I still feel like there is not much structure to what I code in
        JavaScript. Especially since I am trying to use a more functional
        approach rather than an object oriented. Regarding Node and Express, I
        like Node, the command and debugger... but Express as templating tool
        was really uncomfortable to learn. I wonder if other templating tools
        would be better. Express felt so stubborn and just unwilling to
        co-operate in general. Really frustrating. Hated working with it, but
        the result was very satisfying. </p>

      <p><h5>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a
        plan and did it work?</h5>   At first-sight the tasks were simple. I
        knew what I was supposed to do and was determined to tackle tasks as
        they came. Grade 3 tasks were a breeze, the problems arose in grade 4.
        I was trying to solve it, and thought I understood what I was required
        to do but it turns out I had a massive knowledge hole regarding JSON
        responses and GET/POST requests. So much so, that after I finished the
        tasks for Grade 4, I continued to the Grade 5 tasks and realized I had
        already done those and NOT Grade 4. So back I went, re-purposed my
        solutions that I had done earlier and filled that knowledge hole I was
        so blind about. In total, Grades 3-5, it took me a total of 16hrs over
        the weekend, although half the time was spent researching and reading
        online material. I had no plan other than tackling the tasks one by
        one. </p>

      <p><h5>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</h5>   I
        always aim for a 5. Grade 5 requirements were a lot easier for me to understand
        the concept of than Grade 4's. In hindsight Grade 4 was straight
        forward but it turns out I genuinely didn't know what we were required
        to do. I naively thought that all  responses to GET/POST request
        were always JSON. I was very  mistaken. </p>

      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5>   Many, many
        things. How to set up a node server, and organize the modules; How to
        use a templating framework; Basically how to set up a Server-side
        dynamic webpage from scratch. ...Oh, and that stupid JSON response thing, so dumb. </p>

          <span class = "card-title"><h4>S05 - PHP and databases with MySQL/MariaDB</h4></span>
          <hr>
          <p><h5>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</h5>
            Php was for me a lot more intuitive to learn than Python, for
            example. It is a bit "non-forgiving", meaning the syntax is quite
            strict, and I actually liked it. Super easy to learn, I would
            consider it very beginner friendly.
          </p>

          <p><h5>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</h5>
            Syntax wise, it reminds me a lot to C, so not surprising that I
            found it so easy to pick up. Upon usage though, I see it more as a
            scripting language, since there are many instances where once could
            probably substitute php with Python, for example.  </p>

          <p><h5>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did
          you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</h5>
            This time I read all requirements and decided to deliver a solution
            that would tackle all, rather than modularizing them. So, from the
            very beginning, I was in the mindset of solving Grade 5 while making
            sure I ticked the requirements of Grade 3 and 4 a long the way. I
            purposely left out some requirements that I thought of as
            unnecessary. For example, I thought it to be a bit "extra" to create
            a file for each operation on the database, and I am looking forward
            to explaining my reasoning during the 1-2-1 in March.</p>

          <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5>
            I learned beyond the scope of this course. PHP was so intuitive to
            me that I decided to learn Materialize to make things more
            "Ã¼bersichtlich" as we say in German, "with a clear overview". I
            obviously also learned what was in the curriculum i.e. about XAMPP
            and how to make SQL queries usign PHP syntax.</p>

          <hr>
            <p> <h5>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and
        what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</h5>
        I believe the popularity of programming languages depend highly on the
        problems required to be solved. Programmers will always want to find a better
        and simpler way to program, in order to make the steps between idea to final
        deploy as concise as possible. So new languages and frameworks will always be
        introduced. The goal of programming languages is not to survive and be used
        forever, but to make things easier for the programmers. I do think the next
        languages will build upon the tried and tested syntax of their predecessors,
        simplifying these while also adding new features. </p>

              <p> <h5>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming
        languages?</h5>  I think the smartest way to keep up with the industries
        evolving needs is to not stop learning new languages. Thankfully, that has
        always been my goal. The strategy I have in mind consists of learning the
        overview of the most popular general purpose languages at the moment, as most
        nowadays are based on C syntax. Next would be the domain specific languages.
        These languages solve specific problems, and I aim to learn them as needed for
        whatever problem I am trying to solve. I am under no illussions that I will ever
        be "finished" learning new languages, programming or natural. </p>

            <p> <h5>Personal Investigation on the trends of Programming Languages:</h5>
      From my <a
      href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=python,clojure,javascript,java,haskell">own
      research</a>, I can tell that object oriented C-based prorgamming languages are
      more popular than functional, expression oriented, programming languages. I
      decided to delve a bit deeper as to why this is: <br>from this <a
      href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/07/27/why-purely-functional-programming-is-a-great-idea-with-a-misleading-name/#65d5064d20e9">
      FORBES article</a>, albeit a biased, it seems to indicate that it is simply
      a marketing failure in regards to naming these "purely functional" programming
      languages. Since this is a matter of preference, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19550918">this discussion thread</a> is more
      helpful in terms of determining the industry's general consensus, with a grain of salt. From my own
      experience, having been taught Haskell during my studies in Germany, I do have to
      admit these functional languages have always fascinated me, it just takes longer
      to wrap one's head around not modelling everything as objects. To conclude, I
      don't think it would be bad advice to learn more functional programming
      languages and even adopting these paradigms and practices into our Object
      Oriented mentality.  </p>

              <p> <h5>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your
        potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would
        you âsell itâ?</h5>  This is a subjective question. First of all, it depends
        highly on the products or services the company is offering. Secondly, as a third
        year student I don't think I have nearly scratched the surface in terms of what
        type of options there are in this industry. For the purpose of this assignment,
        let this be regarding a video streaming web service much like Netflix and after having
        researched this for a couple of hours only: Based on the technology stack used
        by video streaming giants today Node.js, ASP.NET, jQuery, React, MySQL along
        with a cloud service solution seem to be a good combination. Language wise,
        python, java and javascript have been top options. </p>

          <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5> Prior to this, I was
      already aware that I didn't know half of the programming languages but now I
      know the vastness of options available versus the restrictions imposed by
      industry goals and experience limitations. There is not one programming language better
      than the other. It is, in the end, all about the sweet spot between preference and suitability.  </p>

          <hr>
      <p><h5> Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled
  programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</h5> ASP.NET Core is a
  collection of libraries that form a Framework for building web applications.
  and .NET is an open-source developer platform that allows developers to build
  applications for many different platforms in one place. The languages used are
  C#, F# and Visual Basic. There are many different .NET implementations that
  allow developers ot implement solutions for different things. For eexample,
  .NET Core allows website, server and console app developmet for Windows, Mac
  and Linux. Then there's Xamarin/Mono which allows for mobile app development.
  .NET also has set of API standards common to all .NET implmenetations, known
  as the .NET standard, as well as many libraries to aid in development. </p>

      <p><h5>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we
  learned during the course.</h5> Compared to Node.js based web applications,
  the .NET Framework has much better libraries which run much closer to runtime,
  making these much more stable than Node.js. Minimizing the number of
  dependencies and cenrtalizing them ensures that your project and all projects
  dependencies don't break with a couple of lines of JavaScript. Having said
  that .NET Core seems to be a bit more bare bones and with a much steeper
  learning curve than Node.js, the latter being able to do anything a
  server-side app is expected to do using pure Javascript making it easier for
  new full-stack devs. Compared to PHP, you have to think about costs. ASP.NET
  though open-source requires a License, whereas PHP is free. PHP is also older
  and so has a bigger community than the newly released .NET core, which is very
  handy for the creative php coders that are encouraged to write buggy customizations.

      </p>

      <p><h5>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for
and are you satisfied with the result?</h5> I always aim for 5. I decided to tackle the console app
first, seeing as I already had a lot of experience in building these
specifically with c# from an extracurrilar course I did in the past. I finished
the console app in under 6 hours, had aboslutely no setbacks and felt pretty
good about it. The Web App using MVC and ASP.NET with C# was definitely a lot
more challenging. The MVC design pattern was not the issue per se, as I
remembered from previous projects wher we had to use it. The biggest problem was
figuring out the "web app flow" and communication of user input from view to
controller (not controller to view). I looked into model binding but in the end
that wasn't necessary, as I used the html form to "read" user input, and for the
JSON API I used Postman to generate the put and post request for testing
purposes. It took me 2 days to complete the web application, which upon
finishing I deployed using azure.

      </p>

      <p><h5>What is your TIL for this course section?</h5> During this course
  section, I learned how to build and deploy a ASP.NET Core Web Application
  using Azure, which is for free for students, and for which we get free credits
  for the first month. Console app development I was already very fmailiar with.
