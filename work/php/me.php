    <p>This is my report-page in the course DA377B VT20. This page contains a presentation of myself and will be updated all through the course, ultimately to be handed in, for grading, at the end of the course.</p>



    <p>My name is Delay Wolfsteller, born and half-raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina - the other half in Munich, Germany.</p>

    <p>Mathematics and Languages were always my strong subjects and so programming was a natural progression, albeit a bit later than expected. (What is in a name?)</p>

    <p>My hobbies are staying calm while on this sphere slowly crusing towards the wrath of my archnemesis, the sun; pretending to still retain half the fitness I did 8 years ago; and stand-up comedy.</p>

    <p>On and off I try new hobbies, like wasting money on expensive liquids, either to consume or to lather on the front part of my head (some call it a "face") to protect myself from my above mentioned archnemesis, that
      glorified burning star.</p>

    <p>Please don't contact me.</p>
