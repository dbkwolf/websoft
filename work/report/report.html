</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
  Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?<br>
  Yes, I did know about git and githubpages before this course and tried to use it in my previous projects.
</p>
<p>
  Have you ever created websites before?<br>
  Yes, I have created websites but I am certain I didn't use best practice. just wanted to get it done. Most of
   my knowledge is based on trial and error and working from examples. I read literature on Javascript but unlike
   with Java, I have less experience in knowing where to begin when starting a project.
</P>
<p>
  Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.<br>
  My knowledge within web is very limited to basic CSS, JavaScript and HTML. I made portfolio websites using
   templates and tailoring them to my needs. Also created a website for previous projects.
</p>
<p>
  What is your TIL for this course section?<br>
  TIL: that gitterbox existed; why tags are useful.

<h2>S02</h2>

<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?<br> Yes, I looked at the MDN pages and the Introductory JAvascript tutorials for other courses and managed to get a good understanding of how they all work together at a very basic level </p>
<p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.<br> HTML determines the structure, sort of like the skeletton of the web page, CSS determines how all these structural pieces look like ot the user, and Javascript determines how these function
i.e. the actions available on the webpage, generally to make a dynamic rather than a static website.</p>
<p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.<br> Browser is the client and makes it possible to communicate to the server by providing a platform where websites can be loaded to facilitate this interaction.
The HTTP protocol are the sets of rules that both the browser and server need to follow to be able to communicate.</p>
<p>What is your TIL for this course section? <br> Good resources were provided to look up more information about these topics which i will probably use a lot more of in the future.</p>
