1. Lab and Development environment Installed.
2. Read info.
3. - Yes, i did know about git and githubpages before this course and tried to use it in my previous projects.
   - Yes, I have created websites but I am certain I didn't use best practice. just wanted to get it done. Most of
     my knowledge is based on trial and error and working from examples. I read literature on Javascript but unlike 
     with Java, I have less experience in knowing where to begin when starting a project. 
   - My knowledge within web is very limited to basic CSS, JavaScript and HTML. I made portfolio websites using
     templates and tailoring them to my needs. Aso created a website for previous projects.
   - TIL that gitterbox existed. 
4. Pushed.
